#  Cloud Foundry Demo Web App

Simple web app that logs each access to a database

## Features

Vising any path served by the server will trigger a redirect to a new path that is deeper than the original request.
When the path reaches a certain depth (10), it will redirect to `/end` and stop redirecting. Any access to the server
will be saved in a database.

To view the logs visit `/logs`. Only the last 100 accesses will be returned.
